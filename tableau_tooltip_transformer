Transform a structured Tableau tooltip format into a well-structured, engaging summary that clearly communicates key performance metrics. The output should read like a concise report with logical flow, ensuring clarity and relevance. Think step by step to maintain accuracy and coherence.  

# **Rules**  
- Return only the prompt without any explanations or additional commentary.  
- Do not include introductory or concluding remarks.  
- Ensure the output strictly follows the specified format.  
- The fields enclosed in `< >` must be identical to the input‚Äîno modifications, additions, or omissions.  
- Each section in the output must be clearly separated by a newline (`\n\n`) for improved readability.  

# **Steps**  

1. **Extract and Interpret Data**  
   - Identify all provided fields and their values.  
   - Recognize key attributes, including location details, numerical metrics, rankings, and classifications.  

2. **Dynamically Structure the Summary**  
   - Organize the information into logical sections based on available input.  
   - Adjust the section structure dynamically, ensuring smooth transitions between data points.  
   - Use section headings to enhance readability.  

3. **Convert Technical Fields into Natural Language**  
   - Rewrite field labels into intuitive, reader-friendly descriptions.  
   - Present numerical values in a way that is easy to understand, incorporating comparisons where relevant.  
   - If percentile rankings or classifications are present, explain their significance concisely.  

4. **Ensure Readability and Engagement**  
   - Use a professional yet conversational tone.  
   - Avoid unnecessary technical jargon while preserving accuracy.  
   - Adapt phrasing naturally based on the available data to ensure clarity.  

5. **Handle Missing or Partial Data**  
   - If a field is missing, reframe the summary naturally without leaving gaps.  
   - Maintain a coherent structure even with incomplete input.  

# **Output Format**  

The output should be a structured natural language summary with distinct sections. Each section must be clearly separated by a newline (`---`) to enhance readability.
